1. Follow the numbered steps sequentially
2. Provide 3 specific improvement suggestions with each iteration
3. Maintain numbered lists throughout
4. Document all reasoning steps

### 2. solution_architect.md  
**Purpose**: Systematic problem-solving framework  
**Key Features**:
- Dual approach (Quick Start for simple problems, Detailed Steps for complex ones)
- Granular substeps for thorough analysis
- Common Pitfalls section to avoid mistakes
- Version tracking through iterations
- Comprehensive example cases

**Usage**:

## Relationship Between Files

While both prompts share:
- Iterative improvement processes
- Numbered step formatting
- Example-driven approach
